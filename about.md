# GroupShift

This mod adds a simple utility to the editor that makes it really easy to copy+paste large amounts of repetitive triggers! It works by adding or subtracting a specified amount to the desired property, essentially <cj>SHIFTING</c> the values in either the positive or negative direction. By selecting multiple triggers/objects, pressing copy+paste, then <cj>SHIFTING</c> the values over, you can duplicate the original triggers while keeping the same pattern! This mod was developed for a personal project and its use cases are very niche, but I found it extremely useful so I hope someone else can benefit from its functionality!

## Usage

To change the selected objects' groups, press the <cj>SHIFT</c> button in the Edit Group screen, or press the "Add Group ID" <cg>label</c> above the input field. This mod also lets you <cj>SHIFT</c> any property of the selected triggers, such as the target group of a Move trigger or the count of a Pickup trigger. Just click the <cg>label</c> next to the input of the property you want to <cj>SHIFT</c> to open the popup!
